# Normalisation

Normalisation is used in a database to design and organise the data.
According to Fong and Wong Ting Yan in 2021, data normalization involves schema
restructure and data reorganization in a database. Unnormalized data is
difficult to read and not user-friendly. The main advantages of normalisation
are that it is user-friendly, easy to update, add, and read the data from the
database. Also, it removes data redundancy and improves data integrity. Because
it is organised, it makes it easier to maintain.

On the other hand, the downsides of the normalisation are slow
information retrieval. Relationships and dependencies make the database much
more complex, which can be a downside in some cases. Furthermore, it adds more
steps to inserting the data.
